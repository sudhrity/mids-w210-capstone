# Urban Insights

This is the code repository for [Urban Insights](https://www.urbaninsights.ai/). Urban Insights is a landcover classification and urban planning tool developed as part of the UC Berkeley MIDS Capstone course.

Our mission is to identify irrigated vegetation including lawns and trees along with other land cover including water, soil, and impervious surfaces. Using geographical data, aerial imagery, and advanced ML techniques, the primary objective is to provide insights to support policies and plans aimed at reducing water usage with minimal adverse effects on urban microclimate and accounting for median household income in the process.
